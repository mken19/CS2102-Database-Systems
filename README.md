# CS2102: Database Systems â€“ SQL & Relational Theory

This repository contains structured notes, examples, and exercises from CS2102: Database Systems, with a strong focus on relational databases and SQL programming. The content is organized by topics, covering both theoretical foundations and hands-on SQL query writing.

## Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- `1 Introduction & Relational Model`  
  Overview of database systems, relational model concepts, and schema definitions.

- `2 Entity-relationship Model and its Translation to SQL`  
  E-R diagrams and how to convert them into relational schemas.

### SQL Programming
- `3 SQL 1, Creating Tables with Constraints`  
  Data definition: creating tables, specifying primary/foreign keys, and integrity constraints.

- `4 SQL 2, Simple Queries`  
  Basic SELECT statements, WHERE conditions, and simple joins.

- `5 SQL 3, Algebraic Queries`  
  Mapping SQL queries to relational algebra and understanding their logical foundations.

- `6 SQL 4, Aggregate Queries`  
  GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG.

- `7 SQL 5, Nested Queries`  
  Subqueries, IN/EXISTS clauses, correlated subqueries.

- `8 Theory of Relational Query Languages`  
  Formal query languages like relational algebra and relational calculus.

- `9 Programming with SQL`  
  Using SQL in application code, stored procedures, and interfacing with programming languages.

### Advanced Design & Theory
- `10 Triggers`  
  Defining and using triggers for enforcing constraints and handling events.

- `11 Functional Dependencies`  
  Understanding attribute dependencies for schema design.

- `12 Normalization`  
  Decomposition techniques and normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).

- `13 Relational Design Algorithms`  
  Algorithms for dependency preservation, lossless joins, and schema refinement.
